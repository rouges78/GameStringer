### Post Body:

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on **GameStringer**, a free and open-source desktop app for game translation/localization. After months of development, I'm excited to share it with the community.

## What is it?

GameStringer is a Windows desktop app (built with Tauri + Next.js) that helps you translate games into any language using AI models. It works with:

- **8+ game engines**: Unity, Unreal, Godot, RPG Maker, Ren'Py, GameMaker, Telltale, and even retro ROMs (NES/SNES)
- **6 AI providers**: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, local Ollama, or free MyMemory API
- **10+ file formats**: JSON, PO, RESX, CSV, SRT/VTT/ASS subtitles, XML, YAML

## Key Features

✅ **One-click Unity patching** - Auto-installs BepInEx + XUnity AutoTranslator  
✅ **Batch translation** - Translate entire folders at once  
✅ **Translation Memory** - Reuse previous translations, save time  
✅ **Community Hub** - Share and download TM packs from other users  
✅ **Subtitle support** - SRT, VTT, ASS with timing preservation  
✅ **Retro ROM tools** - Table file editor for NES/SNES/GB hacking  
✅ **REST API** - Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline  
✅ **Join developer forums and share** - Showcase your project and get feedback

## Why I built this

I got frustrated with the existing localization tools - either too expensive, too complex, or didn't support the games I wanted to translate. So I built something that:

1. Works offline (with Ollama)
2. Is completely free
3. Handles multiple engines automatically
4. Has a modern UI that doesn't feel like it's from 2005
